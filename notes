For this scan, we'll be using mythx(mythos), mythril and smartCheck.
These tools are used to automate vulnerabilities scan, but do not replace a manual review by the developer or the security analyst.

MythX and Mythril are SWC registry based tools, which meanns that these tools (derived from same team developers) will look for vulnerabilities found in SWC registry.
SmartCheck has it own knowledge base and also scan the smart contract and report vulnerabilities according to its knowledge base.
